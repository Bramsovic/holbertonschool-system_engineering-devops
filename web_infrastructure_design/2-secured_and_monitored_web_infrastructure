Added Components & Their Purpose

Firewalls 
Purpose: Control incoming and outgoing traffic, reducing attack surface.
Firewall 1: Protects public entry to the load balancer.
Firewall 2: Isolates app nodes from the public, only allows traffic from the load balancer.
Firewall 3: Protects database traffic, only allows connections from app servers.
SSL Certificate
Purpose: Encrypts traffic for data privacy and integrity, preventing MITM attacks.
Termination: Done at the load balancer to reduce overhead on app servers.
Monitoring Clients
Purpose: Track server health, performance, and security metrics.
Setup: Installed on each server, sending logs and metrics to a central monitoring service like Sumologic, Prometheus, or Datadog.
Key Security and Monitoring Concepts

Firewalls
Restrict access to only necessary ports (e.g., 80, 443, 3306).
Filter unwanted traffic, reduce risk of DDoS and brute-force attacks.
HTTPS Traffic
Ensures encryption of data in transit.
Prevents eavesdropping, MITM attacks, and data tampering.
Monitoring
Collects CPU, memory, disk, network metrics.
Sends logs for error tracking and alerting.
Helps identify issues before they cause downtime.
QPS (Queries per Second) Monitoring
Use Nginx access logs, MySQL query logs, or tools like Prometheus to track.
Set up alerts for sudden spikes indicating DDoS or resource exhaustion.
Potential Problems

SSL Termination at Load Balancer
SSL is decrypted at the LB, meaning internal traffic is unencrypted.
Can expose sensitive data if internal network is compromised.
Single MySQL Primary
All writes depend on one serverâ€”if it fails, write operations are blocked.
Risk of data loss or inconsistency without proper replication and failover.
Identical App Nodes
If every node includes all components (web server, app server, database), a single compromised node exposes multiple attack surfaces.
Resource contention can lead to bottlenecks.
